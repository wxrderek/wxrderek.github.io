## About Me
I'm an undergrad at [Duke University](https://www.duke.edu) studying Physics and Mathematics, with a minor in Statistical Science. 
I’m broadly interested in data-driven modeling and scientific machine learning theory/methods for (bio)physics applications. Specifics include:

  + Learning dynamical systems
  + Physics-informed architectures
  + Applications in microbiology and quantum computation

I'm also curious about graph methods, topological/geometric data analysis, and generative modeling. 
I was born in Beijing, China and live in Cary, NC. My given name is Xiran; I go by Derek. 

I've put some hand-written + typed notes from my past courses [here](). All are posted with instructor consent; mistakes are my own. 
Contact me at [xiran.wang@duke.edu](mailto:xiran.wang@duke.edu). 


## Experience
As part of the [Lingchong You Lab](https://www.youlab.bio/), I work with VAE-MLP models for time-series parameter estimation on bacterial growth curves,
specifically targeting chaotic ODE systems. 

As part of the [Liberata](https://liberata.info/) Algorithms Team, I'm developing graph-based 
metrics/algorithms for a new academic publishing system based on continuous authorship shares.

In Summer 2025, I was an AI development intern at [Lenovo](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/) with the 
[Cloud Service Providers](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/servers-storage/solutions/cloud-service-provider/), where I assembled
an AI cluster testbed and looked at network optimization schemes.

## Involvements

I lead the Research Committee for the Statistical Science Majors Union (SSMU), where I'm organizing a 
seminar series and reading group on theory/methods in modern statistics. 

I'm an avid graphic designer of 7+ years, primarily via Photoshop and (more recently) Figma. 
I serve as a co-director of [HackDuke](https://hackduke.org/), where I lead the Design Team. 
I also design for the Duke Math Union, in particular for the annual [Duke Math Meet](https://dukemathmeet.org/). See some past works [here]().

I'm also a recreational photographer. I use an old Nikon D3200 and with a 55-210mm lens. I've done sports photography in the past; 
now I do mostly events and nature. Occasionally I volunteer at the [Sarah P. Duke Gardens](https://gardens.duke.edu/). See some photos [here]().
