I’m broadly interested in data-driven modeling and scientific machine learning theory/methods for (bio)physics applications. Specifics include:\n\nLearning dynamical systems\nPhysics-informed architectures\nApplications in microbiology and quantum computation\n\nI’m also curious about graph methods, topological/geometric data analysis, and generative modeling. I was born in Beijing, China and live in Cary, NC. My given name is Xiran; I go by Derek.\nI’ve put some hand-written course notes and typed notes on select readings/topics here. All are posted with instructor consent; mistakes are my own.\n\n\n\nAs part of the Lingchong You Lab, I work with VAE-MLP models for time-series parameter estimation on bacterial growth curves, specifically targeting chaotic ODE systems.\nAs part of the Liberata Algorithms Team, I’m developing graph-based metrics/algorithms for a new academic publishing system based on continuous authorship shares.\nIn Summer 2025, I was an AI R&D intern at Lenovo with the Cloud Service Providers, where I assembled an AI cluster testbed and looked at network optimization schemes.\n\n\n\nI lead the Research Committee for the Statistical Science Majors Union (SSMU), where I’m organizing a seminar series and reading group on theory/methods in modern statistics.\nI’m an avid graphic designer of 7+ years, primarily via Photoshop and (more recently) Figma. I serve as a co-director of HackDuke, where I lead the Design Team. I also design for the Duke Math Union, in particular for the annual Duke Math Meet. See some past works here.\nI’m also a recreational photographer. I use an old Nikon D3200 and with a 55-210mm lens. I’ve done sports photography in the past; now I do mostly events and nature. Occasionally I volunteer at the Sarah P. Duke Gardens. See some photos here."
